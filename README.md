Project Ideas:
- Trap Shooting app
  - Keeps track of general scores for both types of trap shooting.
  - Easy to input scores
  - Ability to check stats for best and worse sections and percentage estimations for accuracy.





- Offline GPS locations caching that can be overlayed on a map when connected to online. (Too easy if GPS library is simple to use)
  -- Purpose: For use in general landscaping projects or general distance measuring in poor cell areas.
  -- Parking?
  
  
  
  
  
- Reading sailing equipment and interactions with sailing equipment (Too large for independent project?)
